🛠️ Tech StackPython
*  OpenCV (for image processing)
*  YOLOv8 (for currency detection)
*  PyQt6 (for GUI)
*  pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)
* Threading & Queue (for optimized speech processing)

🚀 How It WorksLaunch the application.
1. The webcam starts capturing video.
2. The YOLO model detects and identifies currency denominations.
